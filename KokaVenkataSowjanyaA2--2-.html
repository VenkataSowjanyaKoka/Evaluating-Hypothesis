<pre class="r"><code># Question 3. Conduct a test of significance (level of 0.01) to assess the relationship between a woman smoking
#habits during pregnancy and having a premature baby or not.
#• What are the hypotheses? Express using properly constructed hypothesis statement
#• Select the appropriate test
#• Conduct the test

###Answer: 

### I would like to consider the null hypothesis as,
#H0 : The Mom_Type(Smoker/Non-smoker) and birth(premie/full-term) have no relationship(independent)
### I would like to consider the alternative hypothesis as,
#Ha : The Mom_Type(Smoker/Non-smoker) and birth(premie/full-term) have a relationship(dependent)


###Using Chi-Square test of independence because both the variables we are
#considering are categorical variables(habit and premie) 

###Conducting the test

###Using the data from file
chisq.test(x = NC_Births$habit,y = NC_Births$premie, correct = FALSE)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##  Pearson&#39;s Chi-squared test
## 
## data:  NC_Births$habit and NC_Births$premie
## X-squared = 0.00255, df = 1, p-value = 0.9597</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Question 4. Based on the results from the test in #3, what do statistical evidence suggest about the relationship.
#Provide an explanation of the meaning of the p-value in this case; and by meaning I am not
#referring to the mere slogan: “if it is smaller than the level of significance we reject H0”; or a generic
#interpretation or a story. No more than three sentences.


###Result : Do not Reject null hypothesis
#If P-value is small it means the random variation because of the sampling process alone is not likely to account for the observed difference but,
#the p-value we have for the test is 0.9597 which is greater than the level of significance (0.01), indicating that we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis
#The chi-squared value observed is 0.00255 and the P-value is sufficiently large we do not reject the null hypothesis we can also say 
#the data do not provide a sufficient evidence that #Mom_Type(Smoker/Non-smoker) has a relationship or would effect the birth of the baby to be (premie /full-term).




# Question 5. Conduct a test of significance (level of 0.01) to assess the difference in weight of babies from women
#who smoked during pregnancy and those who did not.

#• What are the hypotheses? Express using properly constructed hypothesis statement
#• Select the appropriate test
#• Conduct the test

###Answer: 

### I would like to consider the null hypothesis as,
#H0 : There is no significant difference in mean values of weights of babies based on women habit(smoker or non-smoker) during pregnancy
# H0 : (Mu(ns) - Mu(s))Diff = 0
### I would like to consider the alternative hypothesis as,
#Ha : There is significant difference in mean values of weights of babies  based on women habit(smoker or non-smoker) during pregnancy
# H0 : (Mu(ns) - Mu(s))Diff != 0

###Using T test of significance because one variable is
#(habit) is categorical and other variable(weight) is numeric

###Using the data from file

t.test(NC_Births$weight~NC_Births$habit,alternative = &quot;two.side&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##  Welch Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  NC_Births$weight by NC_Births$habit
## t = 2.359, df = 171.32, p-value = 0.01945
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  0.05151165 0.57957328

## mean in group nonsmoker    mean in group smoker 
##                7.144273                6.828730</code></pre>

###Answer: 
#Do not Reject null hypothesis
#The P-value is the probability of finding a t value 2.359 given H0 is true, which is 0.01945
###The p-value we have for the test is 0.01945 which is greater than the level of significance (0.01) indicating we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis
#the t-value = 2.359 indicates the evidence is 2.359 standard deviations away (far) from the null hypothesis
